                    Mountains Hotel in Perisher. Thredbo has Australia’s longest ski runs, while Charlotte Pass is
                    Australia’s highest village.

                    The region also produces fresh food and cool-climate wines, including award-winning sparkling wines

                    Australia’s highest peaks are in the Snowy Mountains, where there’s thrilling downhill skiing and
                    snowboarding during the snow season. Lively towns and resorts in this alpine region in southwest NSW
                    are also popular destinations in warmer months for hiking, horseriding, kayaking and
                    fishing.<br><br>

                    The alpine region is the backdrop for Australian poet Banjo Paterson’s epic The Man from Snowy
                    River. There are four resorts in the Kosciuszko National Park, which is named after Australia’s
                    highest peak.

                    Perisher is the Southern Hemisphere’s biggest resort and part of the Epic International ski pass
                    organisation. The other resorts are Thredbo, Charlotte Pass and Selwyn, and there are accommodation
                    options at each to suit a range of budgets. Skiing trips depart Sydney in the snow season, which
                    runs from June to October, with July and August the most popular.

                    The Snowy Mountains are a great destination out of the ski season with trails to suit walkers of all
                    abilities. There’s trout fishing in beautiful mountain lakes and rivers, or you can go horseriding
                    along mountains tracks with operators such as Snowy River Horseback Adventure.

                    The Snowy Valleys Way is a popular driving route in the region. Travel from Sydney by car or bus to
                    the Snowy Mountains. You can also fly from Sydney to Canberra, where you a rent a car or board a
                    bus.<br>
