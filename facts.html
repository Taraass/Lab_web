                Sydney receives over 10 million international and domestic visitors each year for its beaches and
                attractions. Given its favourable weather, rich European history, vibrant economy and diverse lifestyle
                options, it is not surprising that Australia's largest city is such a popular destination for tourist
                and
                migrants. However, Sydney is more than just the Opera House, Harbour Bridge and beaches.
